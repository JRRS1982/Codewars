# Project title

"Financing a purchase" is a 6kyu project from Codewars, designed to test coding
ability in mathematics, fundamentals, algroithms and working with numbers.

### Motivation / Approach

This is a project taken from the codewars website to practice various skills, as
explained above. The approach I took was to implement the code in a process
review manner to practice my routine manner of code creation. i.e. practicing
my coding process.

### Build status

The project is currently under construction, it may not be completed as this is
a practice exercise.

### Screenshots / UML / Notes / Diagrams

Should there be any images, please find them in the images folder of the project.

### User Stories

As a person with an interest in debt,
I want to be able to calculate the balance of my debt after at a point in time,
so that I can be aware of its current balance.

### Problem solving - workings

The input to this problem, will be four int's in an argument processed form the
command line.

The output will be a formatted string containing the number of the payment in
the term  (num_payment), the payment (c), the principle repaid (princ), interest
payment for that month (int) and balance on the debt remaining (balance).

## Tech / framework used

An apple macbook was used to write code using VSCode as an editor and;

* Ruby was used as the main language.
* RSpec used for testing.
* Simplecov is used for test coverage.

### Code style

Rubocop 0.65.0 was used for linting and stylying the Ruby code.

### Tests

A TDD process was used in the development of this project, please see the
attached spec files for details of the testing that was carried out.

## API Use

No API used in this project.

## Reflection / further development

WHAT FURTHER FEATURES WOULD I ADD IF I HAD MORE TIME?

## Credits / team members

No contributions are required at this time, as this is a training exercise.

There is no need to refer to any exteral tutorials as none were used, and this
was a solo project with no exteral assistance.
