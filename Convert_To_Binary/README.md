# Project title

'Convert to Binary' is a command line application that converts a decimal 
numeral input to a binary return of zeros and ones.

This is a simple 8kyu kata from codewars.

## Motivation / Approach

This project was made to practice my software development, and ruby coding.

I decided to create a readme, with user stories, prior to creating any code,
expecint that this would provide time to thinking about the problem, beofore
any tests/code is written.

### Build status

The project / kata is complete, have found a simple solution to the problem and 

### Screenshots / UML / Notes / Diagrams

Should there be any images, please find them in the images folder of the project

### User Stories

As a decimal fan,
I want to get with the times and go binary by returning 1 if i input 1,
so that I get a simple response from my coding machine.

As a decimal fan,
I want to get with the times and go binary by returning 101 if i input 5,
so that I get a less simple response from my coding machine.

As a decimal fan,
I want to get with the times and go binary by returning 1011 if i input 11,
so that I get a simple response from my coding machine.

### Problem solving - workings

The input will be the entry of a binary numberal to the command line.

The output will be the binary number converted into a binary number.

## Tech / framework used

VSCode as an editor;

* Ruby was used as the main language.
* RSpec used for testing.
* Simplecov is used for test coverage.

### Code style

Rubocop 0.65.0 was used for linting and stylying the Ruby code.

### Tests

A TDD process was used in the development of this project, please see the
attached spec files for details of the testing that was carried out.

## Installation / Running / How it works

Please find attached a gem file listing those gems for installation, use the
following to run the file:

1) ruby ./lib/convert_to_binary.rb

## API Use

No API used in this project.

## Reflection / further development

I dont think that any further features are needed at this time.

## Credits / team members

No contributions are required at this time, as this is a training exercise.

This is a solo project with the use of no tutorials.
