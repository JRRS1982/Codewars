This is the basic style readme for the Removing elements Kata from Codewars, it
is a simple practice kata, in this instance in the Ruby language.

The aim is to take an array and remove every second element out of that array.
Always keep the first element and start removing with the next element.

Complete, not beautiful code, but it works and is simple.
